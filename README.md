WARNING: DO NOT Use This Outside KVM or VPS Environments
This software is specifically designed and optimized for use ONLY on VPS running under the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) hypervisor. It MUST NOT be used in any other environments, physical machines, or non-VPS setups. Using it outside these conditions may cause unexpected behavior or system instability.

IPv6 Support
As the author of this project, I want to make it clear that this software DOES NOT support IPv6. If you're in an environment where IPv6 is enabled or required, this software is NOT suitable for your needs. I personally do not support IPv6 and recommend you disable IPv6 on your system to ensure optimal functionality with this software.

Key Points:
Supported environment: KVM-based VPS only.

Unsupported environment: Physical machines, non-VPS environments, and non-KVM hypervisors.

IPv6: This software does not support IPv6. Ensure IPv6 is disabled for proper operation.

Please ensure you meet these requirements before using this software. Thank you for understanding!
